Selection Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly selects the smallest element from the unsorted part of the array and puts it in its correct position.

📌 How it works (very short):

Start from index i = 0.

Find the minimum element from i to the end.

Swap that minimum element with the element at index i.

Move to the next index and repeat.

📌 Example:

Unsorted → [3, 1, 4, 2]
Steps:

Find min → 1 → swap with 3

Find next min → 2 → swap with 4

Continue…
Sorted → [1, 2, 3, 4]

📌 Time Complexity:

Worst: O(n²)

Average: O(n²)

Best: O(n²)
(Works slowly for large data)

📌 Space Complexity:

O(1)
(Uses no extra memory)

📌 Why it's called “Selection”?

Because it selects the smallest element in each round.

📌 Where used?

Small datasets

Learning basic sorting

Situations where memory must be minimal

📌 Key Points to Remember:

Always finds minimum in the unsorted part

Only one swap per round

Slower than Bubble/Insertion Sort for large data




const array = [10, 5, 12, 1, 3]
let n = array.length
for (let i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
  let min = i
  for (let j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
    if (array[min] > array[j]) {
      min = j
    }
  }

  if (min != i) {
    ;[array[i], array[min]] = [array[min], array[i]]
  }
}

console.log(array)
